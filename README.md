# CMSC414
The goal of this project is to explore the use of steganography to conceal an executable within an image file. Specifically, we aim to embed a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack executable within an image, which, when executed, will perform ARP cache poisoning to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
